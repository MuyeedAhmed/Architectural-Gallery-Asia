		<h1><strong>Asian Architectural History</strong></h1>
			<p>The history of architecture traces the changes in architecture through various traditions, regions, overarching stylistic 
				trends, and dates. The branches of architecture are civil, sacred, naval, military, and landscape architecture. 
			</p>
			</br>
			</br>
			</br>
		<h2><strong>Persian architecture</strong></h2>
			<p>The pre-Islamic styles draw on 3-4 thousand years of architectural development from various civilizations of the Iranian 
				plateau. The Islamic architecture of Iran in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor, and has geometrical and 
				repetitive forms, as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles, carved stucco, patterned brickwork, 
				floral motifs, and calligraphy. Iran is recognized by UNESCO as being one of the cradles of civilization.
			</p>	
			<p>Each of the periods of Elamites, Achaemenids, Parthians, and Sassanids were creators of great architecture that over the 
				ages has spread wide and far to other cultures being adopted. Although Iran has suffered its share of destruction, 
				including Alexander The Great's decision to burn Persepolis, there are sufficient remains to form a picture of its
				classical architecture.
			</p>
			<p>The Achaemenids built on a grand scale. The artists and materials they used were brought in from practically all territories 
				of what was then the largest state in the world. Pasargadae set the standard: its city was laid out in an extensive park with 
				bridges, gardens, colonnaded palaces and open column pavilions. Pasargadae along with Susa and Persepolis expressed the 
				authority of The King of Kings, the staircases of the latter recording in relief sculpture the vast extent of the imperial 
				frontier.
			</p>
			<p>With the emergence of the Parthians and Sassanids there was an appearance of new forms. Parthian innovations fully flowered 
				during the Sassanid period with massive barrel-vaulted chambers, solid masonry domes, and tall columns. This influence was 
				to remain for years to come. The roundness of the city of Baghdad in the Abbasid era for example, points to its Persian 
				precedents such as Firouzabad in Fars. The two designers who were hired by al-Mansur to plan the city's design were Naubakht, 
				a former Persian Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, 
				and Mashallah, a former Jew from Khorasan. The ruins of Persepolis, Ctesiphon, Jiroft, Sialk, Pasargadae, Firouzabad, Arg-Ã© Bam, 
				and thousands of other ruins may give us merely a distant glimpse of what contribution Persians made to the art of building.
			</p>
			<p>The fall of the Sassanid Empire to invading Islamic forces ironically led to the creation of remarkable religious buildings in Iran. 
				Arts such as calligraphy, stucco work, mirror work, and mosaic work, became closely tied with architecture in Iran in the new era. 
				Archaeological excavations have provided sufficient documents in support of the impacts of Sasanian architecture on the architecture 
				of the Islamic world. Many experts believe the period of Persian architecture from the 15th through 17th Centuries to be the most 
				brilliant of the post-Islamic era. Various structures such as mosques, mausoleums, bazaars, bridges, and different palaces have 
				mainly survived from this period.
			</p>
			<p>In the old Persian architecture, semi-circular and oval-shaped vaults were of great interest, leading Safavi architects to display 
				their extraordinary skills in making massive domes. In the words of D. Huff, a German archaeologist, the dome is the dominant 
				element in Persian architecture. Domes can be seen frequently in the structure of bazaars and mosques, particularly during the 
				Safavi period in Isfahan. Iranian domes are distinguished for their height, proportion of elements, beauty of form, and roundness 
				of the dome stem. The outer surfaces of the domes are mostly mosaic faced, and create a magical view. Safavi Isfahan tried to 
				achieve grandeur in scale (Isfahan's Naghsh-i Jahan Square is the 6th largest square worldwide) knowledge about building tall 
				buildings with vast inner spaces. However, the quality of ornaments was decreased in comparison with those of the 14th and 15th 
				centuries.
			</p>
			<p>The great mosques of Khorasan, Isfahan, and Tabriz each used local geometry, local materials, and local building methods to express
			 in their own ways the order, harmony, and unity of Islamic architecture. And thus when the major monuments of Islamic Persian 
			 architecture are examined, they reveal complex geometrical relationships, a studied hierarchy of form and ornament, and great 
			 depths of symbolic meaning.
			</p>
			</br>
		<h2><strong>Islamic architecture</strong></h2>
			<p>Islamic architecture has encompassed a wide range of both secular and religious architecture styles from the foundation of Islam to 
				the present day, influencing the design and construction of buildings and structures within the sphere of Islamic culture. Some 
				distinctive structures in Islamic architecture are mosques, tombs, palaces and forts, although Islamic architects have of course 
				also applied their distinctive design precepts to domestic architecture.
			</p>
			<p>The wide spread and long history of Islam has given rise to many local architectural styles, including Abbasid, Persian, Moorish, 
				Timurid, Ottoman, Fatimid, Mamluk, Mughal, Indo-Islamic, Sino-Islamic and Afro-Islamic architecture. Notable Islamic architectural 
				types include the early Abbasid buildings, T-type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of Anatolia.- Also, Islamic architecture 
				also discourages illustrations of anything living, such as animals and humans.
			</p>
			</br>
		<h2><strong>Indian architecture</strong></h2>
			<p>Indian architecture encompasses a wide variety of geographically and historically spread structures, and was transformed by the 
				history of the Indian subcontinent. The result is an evolving range of architectural production that, although it is difficult 
				to identify a single representative style, nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. The diversity of 
				Indian culture is represented in its architecture. It is a blend of ancient and varied native traditions, with building types, 
				forms and technologies from West and Central Asia, as well as Europe. Architectural styles range from Hindu temple architecture 
				to Islamic architecture to western classical architecture to modern and post-modern architecture.
			</p>
			<p>India's Urban Civilization is traceable to Mohenjodaro and Harappa, now in Pakistan. From then on, Indian architecture and civil 
				engineering continued to develop, and was manifestated temples, palaces and forts across the Indian subcontinent and neighbouring 
				regions. Architecture and civil engineering was known as sthapatya-kala, literally "the art of constructing".
			</p>
			<p>The temples of Aihole and Pattadakal are the earliest known examples of Hindu temples. There are numerous Hindu as well as Buddhist
			 temples that are known as excellent examples of Indian rock-cut architecture. According to J.J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson,[8] the 
			 Sulbasutras were appendices to the Vedas giving rules for constructing altars. "They contained quite an amount of geometrical 
			 knowledge, but the mathematics was being developed, not for its own sake, but purely for practical religious purposes."
			</p>
			<p>During the Kushan Empire and Mauryan Empire, Indian architecture and civil engineering reached regions like Baluchistan and Afghanistan. 
				Statues of Buddha were cut out, covering entire mountain cliffs, like in Buddhas of Bamyan, Afghanistan. Over a period of time, 
				ancient Indian art of construction blended with Greek styles and spread to Central Asia. It includes the architecture of various 
				dynasties, such as Hoysala architecture, Vijayanagara architecture and Western Chalukya architecture.
			</p>
			<p>The Church of St. Anne which is cast in the Indian Baroque Architectural style under the orientation of the most eminent architects 
				of the time. It is a prime example of the blending of traditional Indian styles with western 
			</p>
			</br>
		<h2><strong>Indonesian architecture</strong></h2>
			<p>The architecture of Indonesia reflects both the cultural diversity of the region and its rich historical inheritance. 
				The geographic position of Indonesia means a transition between the culture of Asian Hindu-Buddhism architecture and 
				animistic architecture of Oceania. Indonesian wide range of vernacular styles is the legacy of an Austronesian architectural 
				tradition characterized by wooden pile dwellings, high pitched roofs and extended roof ridges. The temples of Java, on the other 
				hand, share an Indian Hindu-Buddhist ancestry, typical of Southeast Asia; though indigenous influences have led to the creation 
				of a distinctly Indonesian style of monumental architecture. Gradual spread of Islam through the region from the 12th century 
				onwards creates an Islamic architecture which betray a mixture of local and exotic elements. Arrival of the European merchant, 
				especially the Dutch, shows incorporation of many Indonesian features into the architecture of the native Netherlands to produce 
				an eclectic synthesis of Eastern and Western forms apparent in the early 18th-century Indies Style and modern New Indies Style. 
				The years that followed independence saw the adoption of Modernist agenda on the part of Indonesian architects apparent in the 
				architecture of the 1970s and 1980s.

		<h2><strong>Chinese architecture</strong></h2>
			<p>From the Neolithic era Longshan Culture and Bronze Age era Erlitou culture, the earliest rammed earth fortifications exist, 
				with evidence of timber architecture. The subterranean ruins of the palace at Yinxu dates back to the Shang Dynasty 
				(c. 1600 BCâ1046 BC). In historic China, architectural emphasis was laid upon the horizontal axis, in particular the 
				construction of a heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not as well emphasized. 
				This contrasts Western architecture, which tends to grow in height and depth. Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of 
				the width of the buildings. The deviation from this standard is the tower architecture of the Chinese tradition, which began 
				as a native tradition and was eventually influenced by the Buddhist building for housing religious sutras â 
				the stupa â which came from India. Ancient Chinese tomb model representations of multiple story residential towers and watchtowers 
				date to the Han Dynasty (202 BCâ220 AD). However, the earliest extant Buddhist Chinese pagoda is the Songyue Pagoda, a 40 m (131 ft) 
				tall circular-based brick tower built in Henan province in the year 523 AD. From the 6th century onwards, stone-based structures 
				become more common, while the earliest are from stone and brick arches found in Han Dynasty tombs. The Zhaozhou Bridge built from 
				595 to 605 AD is China's oldest extant stone bridge, as well as the world's oldest fully stone open-spandrel segmental arch bridge.
			</p>
			<p>The vocational trade of architect, craftsman, and engineer was not as highly respected in premodern Chinese society as the scholar-bureaucrats who were drafted into the government by the civil service examination system. Much of the knowledge about early Chinese architecture was passed on from one tradesman to his son or associative apprentice. However, there were several early treatises on architecture in China, with encyclopedic information on architecture dating back to the Han Dynasty. The height of the classical Chinese architectural tradition in writing and illustration can be found in the Yingzao Fashi, a building manual written by 1100 and published by Lie Jie (1065â1110) in 1103. In it there are numerous and meticulous illustrations and diagrams showing the assembly of halls and building components, as well as classifying structure types and building components.
				There were certain architectural features that were reserved solely for buildings built for the Emperor of China. One example is the use of yellow roof tiles; yellow having been the Imperial color, yellow roof tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the Forbidden City. The Temple of Heaven, however, uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by brackets, a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The wooden columns of the buildings, as well as the surface of the walls, tend to be red in colour.
				Many current Chinese architectural designs follow post-modern and western styles.

			</br>
		<h2><strong>Korean architecture</strong></h2>
			<p>Korean architecture has a long history of 8,000 years. It has its own cultural identity different from Chinese or Japanese 
				architecture. The basic construction form is more or less similar to Eastern Asian building system. From a technical point 
				of view, buildings are structured vertically and horizontally. A construction usually rises from a stone subfoundation to a 
				curved roof covered with tiles, held by a console structure and supported on posts; walls are made of earth (adobe) or are 
				sometimes totally composed of movable wooden doors. Architecture is built according to the k'an unit, the distance between 
				two posts (about 3.7 meters), and is designed so that there is always a transitional space between the "inside" and the "outside."
			</p>
			<p>The console, or bracket structure, is a specific architectonic element that has been designed in various ways through time. 
				If the simple bracket system was already in use under the Goguryeo kingdom (37 BCEâ668 CE)âin palaces in Pyongyang, for 
				instanceâa curved version, with brackets placed only on the column heads of the building, was elaborated during the early 
				Koryo dynasty (918â1392). The Amita Hall of the Pusok temple in Antong is a good example. Later on (from the mid-Koryo 
				period to the early Choson dynasty), a multiple-bracket system, or an inter-columnar-bracket set system, was developed 
				under the influence of Mongol's Yuan dynasty (1279â1368). In this system, the consoles were also placed on the transverse 
				horizontal beams. Seoul's Namtaemun Gate Namdaemun, Korea's foremost national treasure, is perhaps the most symbolic example 
				of this type of structure. In the mid-Choson period, the winglike bracket form appeared (one example is the Yongnyongjon 
				Hall of Jongmyo, Seoul), which is interpreted by many scholars as an example of heavy Confucian influence in Joseon Korea, 
				which emphasized simplicity and modesty in such shrine buildings. Only in buildings of importance like palaces or sometimes 
				temples (Tongdosa, for instance) were the multicluster brackets still used. Confucianism also led to more sober and simple 
				solutions.
			</p>

		<h2><strong>Japanese architecture</strong></h2>
			<p>Japanese architecture has as long a history as any other aspect of Japanese culture. Influenced heavily by Chinese and Korean architecture, it also shows a number of important differences and aspects which are uniquely Japanese.</p>
			<p>Two new forms of architecture were developed in medieval Japan in response to the militaristic climate of the times: the castle, a defensive structure built to house a feudal lord and his soldiers in times of trouble; and the shoin, a reception hall and private study area designed to reflect the relationships of lord and vassal within a feudal society.</p>
			<p>Because of the need to rebuild Japan after World War II, major Japanese cities contain numerous examples of modern architecture. Japan played some role in modern skyscraper design, because of its long familiarity with the cantilever principle to support the weight of heavy tiled temple roofs. New city planning ideas based on the principle of layering or cocooning around an inner space (oku), a Japanese spatial concept that was adapted to urban needs, were adapted during reconstruction. Modernism became increasingly popular in architecture in Japan starting in the 1950s.</p>
